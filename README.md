HW2 Team Assignment. 

Functional Requirements: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ne76NKbbJQZZfn9gr0Ll6qXji_w85t_m6EUWgtwFqds/edit 
_______________________________________________________________________________________

Homework 2 has an even more limited specification than Homework 1. In Homework 1, you were actually given some idea of what to expect. In Homework 2, your mission is to show that you can come up with something interesting to do to improve Homework 1. As you have noticed by now, we are merging teams of 2 to form teams of 4 (or 5), which will likely result in some spirited discussions about what to keep vs. throw away from your work on Homework 1.

Your mission is simple. You must come up with five (5) meaningful improvements (as a new team) to the notetaking system we have created in Homework 1. You may even find yourself having to finish some of the work that was left undone in Homework 1.

As you begin your mission, you are going to write requirements for the 5 improvements you plan to make. Unlike in Homework 1, you’re going to spend the first few days writing a document explaining how you will create the dream (perfect) notetaking system, which will be better than Google Keep, Evernote, or OneNote (just to name a few). Your requirements document is to be created on Google Docs and will be linked to your Files and Docs section with commenting enabled. I suggest you create the empty document and start working on it right away.

More than likely, your group is going to spend some time (in your Campfire on Basecamp) talking about the features you plan to add--before you actually write the document. We will be paying close attention to the amount of time you and ALL of your teammates are spending on a meaningful discussion about the new requirements, starting on September 27.

Once you have written a document describing the requirements, Nieky (our beloved TA) and I (your possibly beloved professor) will be reviewing your documents to make a determination about whether your document is “ambitious enough”. Those deemed not to be ambitious, unfortunately, will need to be revised, which could impact the development schedule. However, the dates for various checkins will not be extended.

Once your requirements are “approved”, which will come in the form of a message to your Campfire on Basecamp, you’ll be able to begin actual development work as a team. Unlike in the previous assignment, you will need to use Basecamp to-do items to make sure everyone is assigned meaningful tasks aimed at completing the new version of the notetaking system. 

There will be weekly checkpoints on this assignment on the next few Mondays:

Monday, October 2 - Requirements document due at 9 a.m.
Monday, October 9 - Prototype with new features and video of all developers doing a code walkthrough
Monday, October 16 - Final version

As in Homework 1, you will be graded based on sustained activity in your project. You can demonstrate activity through (but not limited to) the following:

Basecamp activity (Campfire, Todo, Files/Docs, Message Board)
Google Docs (for writing, mainly)
Design Diagrams (e.g. using UML or other drawing tools)
git commit (daily)
Evidence of project management
Issue Tracking in GitHub
Reading papers and websites on related work (and linking same to Files/Docs)
User Interface design/mockups
Making use of advanced technologies (e.g. server side, cloud, client side, etc.)
Extended use of git, especially branching and merging as development gets underway.
Use of a continuous integration system like Travis
Making a website on GitHub pages for your project

If you have any of these in your project, you will be rated on a 0-4 scale (0=Not Present, 4=Exemplar Project). Should you have any other activity, you will have an opportunity to “self-report” it on a form (to be provided at the end) and give yourself a rating. Because the above are so important, you will need to have at least 5 of the above present before adding your own categories.

There is also no maximum number of points you can earn. Teams will be ranked by points and the grades will be partitioned based on effort (with the hope that most are C/C+ or better). Please do not risk your grade by doing the minimum. We will notice.

Unlike in Homework 1, there are no constraints on what languages, libraries, and technologies you use. You are not limited to writing a command-line program. However--and this is a big however--if you use any advanced server-side techniques, you must be able to deploy them on a cloud-based platform (e.g. Heroku, Amazon Web Services, etc.) And your program must be able to run when checked out by the TA or instructor (especially if we have any doubts about whether it really works). 

As in Homework 1, you must have a build script and make sure your program can be run--and tested--on checkout. As such, you need to have an automatic build script that manages any external dependencies. Therefore, languages such as Java, Scala, Python, Ruby and Node.js are encouraged. Others? You might want to check with me first.

I’m going to get questions about this topic: Can I use databases? Can I write RESTful web services? Yes, but not all students know how to do these things upon entering COMP 330. But you need to make sure that you have a way of deploying your code on a cloud-based server.

In other words, if you are less experienced, you are encouraged to keep it simple. We will not give better grades based on who knows the most as a team. We’re going to give grades based on what you produce and whether there is daily progress on your project. Those who produce the most process-related deliverables will earn the highest grades. It is possible to have a fully-working program that does not get a good grade. I do not recommend taking your chances when it comes to this last point.
